  I am a student from India and want to learn Advanced Django. I think it will be beneficial for my work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very much difficult for me to gather such an amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are peer-reviewed which I believe will be an invaluable learning opportunity.


My main career goal is to learn every day. I want to learn and progress in my career. In Computer Science, it requires constant learning and improvement. Taking this course will help me to learn and study this Advanced Django and also to implement it. It can help me advance in my knowledge. This course will help me in defining Advanced Django, understand how Advanced Django could potentially impact our business and industry, write a thought leadership piece regarding use cases and industry potential of Advanced Django, explain Advanced Django to clients, and friends, and join a community of economists, business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technologists that are shaping this technology as we speak. Identifying which aspects of Advanced Django seem most important and relevant to us, Walking away with a strong foundation in where Advanced Django is going, what it does, and how to prepare for it. Advanced Django course will help me achieve it to learn. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my knowledge about the various fields of technology.
